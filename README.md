Stackoverflow Code Beautify
==========================

[Google Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stackoverflow-code-beauti/pljeafjjkkbacckkollfejkciddacmeb)

Beautify and format selected code as needed.
-------------------------------------------

Format and beautify selected code when editing questions and answers on Stackoverflow (or anywhere else for that matter). 

This extension is not limited to the Stackoverflow web site - I just came up with the idea while reviewing on Stackoverflow - so it can be used anywhere.

If you have any feature requests or found any bugs, just post a comment.

Based on jsbeautifier.org.
